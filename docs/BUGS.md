# Bugs

Defects: shipped behaviour that is wrong, lossy, unsafe or slower than it claims. Format and
ordering are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Formats
- [M · blocked: symphonia] A file embedding a huge picture still costs one materialisation:
  symphonia 0.6.1 reads it into its own buffer before `probe_cover_art` can weigh it; its
  `limit_visual_bytes` is honoured by no reader
- [M · blocked: opus-rs] A stereo Opus stream's mono packets (libopus drops to mono near 16-24 kbps)
  go to a second `OpusDecoder` (`opus.rs` `other`) whose state is minutes stale or empty, and the
  main decoder misses them: a click, and band energies mispredicted for some frames, at every
  mono/stereo switch of a low-bitrate podcast; `opus-rs` 0.1.37 refuses a packet whose TOC channel
  bit differs from the decoder's (`Channel count mismatch`) and keeps no stream-channel state a
  mono packet could be decoded against, so the fix is a decoder that switches (upstream or vendored)

## Later: The vault
- [M] A cover's lossless JXL is read back from memory, not the staged file; a 16-bit PNG is
  quantised to 8 bits, an animated picture keeps its first frame and an ICC profile is dropped
  (compared against the same lossy decode, so it passes)
- [L] The key is the PCM alone: two tracks of the same samples at another rate, count or mask
  (digital silence) share an object, and a standing object is taken on its size alone; needs a
  migration
- [M] Blanking a Matroska file stops at an element of unknown size or after 65 536 elements and
  lands what it blanked so far as stripped; a `TrackEntry` name, chapters and an MP4's track-level
  `meta` are never blanked; an MP4 past 4 096 boxes keeps every tag
