# Features

Gaps: what is not built, a limit by design, an unsupported format or a behaviour the listener cannot
reach. Format and ordering are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Android parity
- [M · blocked: hardware] Android offers no DoP: a marked stream needs the USB bit-perfect mixer at a
  32-bit word (Oboe-rs has no packed 24-bit one) and a DAC that decodes it to prove the markers
  arrive untouched

## iOS parity
- [M · blocked: xtool] iOS has no widget: a WidgetKit extension xtool builds is linked empty and,
  linked whole, traps in `ExtensionFoundation` before a widget registers (xtool issue 313)
- [M · blocked: Apple] iOS has no CarPlay: the CarPlay audio entitlement is granted by Apple to a
  paid team on request, and a free signing cannot carry it
- [M · blocked: rust nightly] Pointer authentication (an `arm64e` slice) is not adopted: the Rust
  library builds for `aarch64-apple-ios` on stable, and `arm64e-apple-ios` needs a nightly
  `build-std`

## Playback and output
- [L · 0.2.0] One playback stream and one capture stream only; concurrent playback streams unsupported
- [M · blocked: pipewire-rs] A rebind or turn inside a row that moves the rate while
  `force-graph-rate` pins it (on by default), or switches the pin, still reopens the PipeWire stream:
  the pin is the node's `node.rate` property, which only `pw_stream_update_properties` moves, and
  pipewire-rs 0.10.1 (and its main branch) does not wrap it; no param, `Props` key or per-node
  metadata reaches a node's properties, and the `settings` metadata's `clock.force-rate` would force
  every client's graph and outlive a crash
- [M · blocked: Oboe] A turn of rate, word or channel count inside a row (the song's own rate while
  *Match the song's sample rate* is on, or a route moving between mixed, exclusive and bit-perfect)
  still closes the Oboe stream and opens another: an open stream's rate, format and channel count
  are fixed, and the callback is typed by them

## Formats
- [M · blocked: ape-decoder] A 32-bit stereo Monkey's Audio, integer or float, is refused:
  `ape-decoder` 0.3.2 narrows the side channel to 32 bits before undoing it
- [M · blocked: symphonia-codec-wavpack] A `.wvc` correction file beside a hybrid WavPack is never
  opened, so the file plays and is billed as lossy: 0.1.1, the only release, reads a held zero's
  correction from the wrong range
- [L · blocked: symphonia] Opus mapping families 2, 3 and 255 are refused by its `OpusHead` reader;
  families 2 and 3 would also need projection decoding

## Tagging
- [M · blocked: lofty] `.caf`, `.mka` and the DSD containers have no writer (lofty 0.25.4 has no
  such file type); `.oga` alone could be mapped to Vorbis by hand

## Providers and network

## Device sync
- [M · 0.2.0] A study's acoustic print (Chromaprint) and its recognition are still asked for by each
  device itself (`Change::Answer` carries kept lyrics, studies and releases; covers and Lyricsfiles go
  device to device, `sync.md`): a print is decoded again on every device and AcoustID asked again at
  the reference's paced rate. They could be asked of a connected device as covers and Lyricsfiles are
  (`ToPeer`), keyed by the `WholeFile` a study already names and landing only on a copy that is the
  same file with a study at this `JUDGED_UNDER`; a recognition also wants its agreement weighed
  again against the receiving row's own name (`enrich::agreement`), since a shared one was weighed
  against the sender's. Covers and Lyricsfiles are asked only of a device a connection already
  stands to, never punched for, and an album known only as its release group asks the archive. The
  phones take and send kept lyrics and studies but no release (their catalog keeps no release a
  strict landing could weigh) and neither ask nor answer covers or Lyricsfiles

## Equaliser and DSP

## Search
- [M · blocked: service] A pasted Spotify, TIDAL or Apple Music playlist link lists only the songs its
  public page holds (TIDAL's embed page fifty, the others at most a hundred), since none offers a keyless
  route past it (their APIs want a registered client or the listener's sign-in); Spotify's and Apple
  Music's name no ISRC either, so each of their songs is found by the strict title and artist search
- [L · blocked: service] A lyric reaches only a row the catalog holds; no keyless service indexes
  lyric text (LRCLIB's text search finds none)

## Identification
- [M · 0.2.0] AAC's quantiser steps were weighed only on ffmpeg's encoder (every decode at 256 and
  320 kbps found) and faac's (18 of 31 at 160 kbps): no Apple, FhG or fdk encode weighed, and a
  lossy decode with neither a wall nor AAC's frames (a resampled AAC, an MP3 or Vorbis with no
  lowpass) still reads as lossless

## Later: Sources and providers
- [M · blocked: services] The Bandcamp and Discogs links an `Identity` carries are read by nothing;
  no provider asks either
- [M · blocked: servers] Subsonic matches a recording id or ISRC but not the release-track id the
  inbox accepts: the API's `musicBrainzId` names the recording; nothing in a song names the release
  track

## Later: The vault
- [L] A JPEG cover is kept byte for byte where its lossless JXL is larger, never smaller than it: a
  byte-exact JPEG transcode (`jxl-encoder` 0.3, AGPL, opt-in) is an unproven spike
- [L · blocked: flacenc] `flacenc` 0.5.1, the latest, caps the Rice parameter at 14, the rate at 96
  kHz and the depth at 24 bits: a 24-bit rip loses to `flac -8` by ~15 % and is kept; a 192 kHz rip
  is never a FLAC

## Later: Equaliser and DSP extras
- [M] *Fit the preamp* on both desktop and phones leaves room correction and the volume stage
  outside what it runs (the phones hold no applied response the fit could read, and the convolver
  is not part of the stage the decode runs); the estimate from kept bands is not a bound, a song
  whose peaks gather in one band can still pass the fit, and a bound needs each band's own peak
  kept beside its level (a new `band_levels`-style column and migration step on both catalogs, and
  an analysis pass that splits the signal into the 29 bands)
- [L] AutoEq is the only correction source, fetched one device at a time
- [M] Lossy restoration was tuned and tested on ffmpeg's own MP3, AAC and Vorbis encodes of
  synthetic tones, walls and music-like notes at several bitrates, not on a breadth of real music
  per codec and bitrate and not on other encoders (Fraunhofer, Apple, Nero, libfdk); the thresholds
  of its short-hole reader and of the wall it follows were set on those encodes and need a corpus
  of real files to be trusted
- [M · blocked: symphonia] A downmix folds by position, or unplaced channels in turn: a stream's own
  downmix coefficients are not read, because the only decoded stream that could carry them is a
  multichannel AAC whose program config element (`matrix_mixdown_idx`, `pseudo_surround`)
  symphonia-codec-aac 0.6.1 refuses (`aac: program config`, and more than two channels is `aac too
  complex`)

## Later: Lyrics
- [L · blocked: gpui] The sung line cannot grow as it lights: gpui 0.2.2 on Linux draws a glyph on a
  whole pixel vertically (`SUBPIXEL_VARIANTS_Y = 1`) and cosmic-text hints every size, so a type
  size in motion shimmers and hops; the line only brightens
- [M · blocked: format] Where a sheet gives a line no end (a plain LRC never; only an enhanced one
  with a closing stamp, or a Lyricsfile), when it goes out is guessed from its text length: a held
  note can be put out under the dots early
- [L · blocked: sources] `Lyrics` holds no translation beside the original. Only an LRC line marked
  `[v1:]` or `[v2:]` names its singer; elsewhere a second voice is read off overlapping lines alone
  and a third is folded onto the two

## Later: Listen and recognition
- [M · blocked: Shazam] Reached through an undocumented endpoint (`amp.shazam.com`); a change on its
  side stops recognition
