# Testing and build

Proof and plumbing: what no test, fuzz target, hardware or CI step yet covers, and dependencies and
packaging that need a decision. Format and ordering are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Playback and output
- [L · blocked: hardware] No forced graph rate change proved against hardware (the only card here
  offers 48 kHz alone), nor DoP against a DAC that decodes it

- [S · blocked: hardware] A zone handover's alignment is proved against a fake graph whose
  callbacks run late by varying amounts while their device timestamps stay true (within two
  frames); no two devices here are heard side by side, so how closely two real sound cards meet
  (how true their own timestamps and latency readings are, and clock drift over the overlap) has
  not been measured

- [S · blocked: hardware] A phone driven from another device is proved on the host over a real engine
  and the peer wire alone: audio focus asked for a play pressed elsewhere (`soundBegan`) and the
  iPhone's session activated for one (`SessionAsked`) have not been heard on a device

- [S · blocked: hardware] Android zones on two outputs are proved on the host alone: no USB DAC or
  Bluetooth device is attached here, so whether Android plays two Oboe streams asking two device ids
  (`setDeviceId`) on those two devices at once, rather than routing media to one, has not been heard

- [S · blocked: hardware] Android's *Curves for other outputs* page (`OutputCurvesScreen`) has not
  been seen: the emulator offers one output, so no other output keeps a curve and the equaliser
  never shows the row; its arithmetic is held by `OutputCurvesTest` alone

- [S · blocked: hardware] An iPhone following the song's rate (`follow-song-rate`) is not proved on
  a USB DAC: no device is attached here, so neither the route taking `preferredSampleRate` nor the
  gap of the RemoteIO reopen it causes has been heard


- [S · blocked: hardware] No Google Cast receiver has been played to: the Cast stream is proved
  against a loopback fake alone (`resonate-cast/tests/receiver.rs`), and no Chromecast, Nest
  speaker or speaker group is on the network here, so whether the Default Media Receiver takes an
  endless `LIVE` FLAC from the player's address, how `currentTime` runs on it, and the TLS 1.2
  handshake of an older receiver have not been heard

- [S · blocked: hardware] Cast on a phone has never been heard against a real receiver: the
  phones' receivers are proved on the host by what `resonate-mobile` holds of them (an address
  parsed, held, refused when it is neither an address nor a name, listed with the renderers and
  forgotten) and by `resonate-cast`'s loopback fake alone, so the mDNS browse over Wi-Fi (Android's
  `MulticastLock` held), a receiver given by name from a phone, a Default Media Receiver fetching
  the phone's stream across the network and an iPhone's browse being refused without the multicast
  entitlement have not been seen

- [S · blocked: hardware] A phone's zone on a network renderer is proved on the host alone, over a
  fake renderer on loopback: no renderer is on this network and neither phone ran it, so the
  search over Wi-Fi (Android's `MulticastLock` held), a renderer fetching the phone's stream across
  the network, playback with the screen off (no Wi-Fi lock is taken) and an iPhone's search being
  refused without the multicast entitlement have not been seen

## iOS
- [M · blocked: hardware] The Core Audio tests (`resonate-coreaudio --test stream`: a tone through
  the shared sink, a hog-mode rate switch and its restoration, a 24-bit ramp read back bit for bit
  through a loopback device) need an output device, and the hog and bit-exact halves a device named
  *BlackHole*; they skip without one, so they have run nowhere
- [S · blocked: Xcode's processor] `ios/app-intents.py` is held by a fixture of `Siri.swift`'s const
  values and its own output, never by Apple's: it was compared with `appintentsmetadataprocessor`
  by hand, on another xtool app's fixtures (a plain intent, a `String` parameter, App Shortcuts),
  and `AudioPlaybackIntent` as `AudioStarting` was never set beside Apple's output for it. The
  processor is an arm64 Mach-O

## Identification
- [S · blocked: registered key] AcoustID never reached with a real key; its fixture is written from
  the documentation and `tests/live.rs` has no AcoustID test

## Catalog
- [S · blocked: flatpak] Trashing through the portal is proved from a `bwrap` sandbox built to
  Flatpak's pattern (`.flatpak-info`, a filtering `xdg-dbus-proxy`, `bwrapinfo.json`), not from a
  `flatpak run` of the real manifest: no `flatpak` is installed here, so the document portal and the
  manifest's own permissions have never been in the path

## Providers and network
- [S · blocked: a listener's account] `resonate-ytmusic`'s gated live test (`tests/live.rs`,
  `RESONATE_YTMUSIC_TESTS`, with `RESONATE_YTMUSIC_COOKIES`, `RESONATE_YTMUSIC_SONG`,
  `RESONATE_YTMUSIC_PLAYLIST`) has never been run: it lists an album song, reads the head of its best
  tier and reads a playlist of the account, and nothing here holds an account or has run it at all
- [S · blocked: NetworkManager] `resonate-mpris`'s `metered.rs` has only been run against a
  stand-in `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager` on a private bus: the `Metered` values a real manager
  sends for a phone hotspot or a connection the listener marked metered, and that it announces a
  change as a `PropertiesChanged` on the manager object, were taken from its documentation
- [S · blocked: network] That the hosted hifi service still answers a request carrying neither
  `Origin` nor `Referer` is proved by its gated live test alone (`RESONATE_HIFI_LIVE_TESTS`), which
  nothing here has run
- [S · blocked: an account without Opus 774] A kept song's AAC tier (`Aac141`, `.m4a`) has not been
  measured: nothing here has downloaded one, so whether the tag writer takes DASH's fragmented MP4 and
  the decoder probes it is unproved; it is reached only where `774` is absent
- [S · blocked: registered app] No real Spotify account has been read: the sign-in and the reads are
  proved against a fake server on loopback whose fixtures are written from the published Web API
  reference, and `resonate-online`'s gated live test (`RESONATE_ONLINE_TESTS`,
  `RESONATE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `RESONATE_SPOTIFY_TOKEN_FILE`) has never run; a registered app's
  development mode (`403` on a playlist the account only follows), `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT` accepted as
  registered and the rotation of its refresh tokens are as Spotify documents them, unmeasured; on a
  phone, the browser reaching the boundary's loopback listener (an `ASWebAuthenticationSession` on
  iOS, a browser in front of a backgrounded process on Android) has not been seen on a device

## Testing
- [S · 0.9.1] `resonate-win32`'s real side behind its seam has run nowhere: the sequencing is held by
  the fakes on every host and the real implementations only cross-checked by `cargo xwin`, so a
  Windows run of `cargo test -p resonate-win32 --features console` (the end-of-search code, the Game
  Mode value, the line-input flags) is still owed
- [S · blocked: a second compositor] The drag test has run on KWin alone: no other compositor
  (`sway`, `weston`, `mutter`, `cage`, `labwc`) is installed here, so another's data-device and
  drag-icon behaviour is untried
- [M · blocked: network namespaces] Hole punching is proved over loopback alone; two devices
  behind real NATs, a phone on a mobile network and a Linux desktop, have not been driven against a
  live server. NATs built from user namespaces and nftables need a `veth` pair, which the running
  kernel here has no module for (no `/lib/modules`) and no root to load
- [S · blocked: network namespaces] Nearby meeting over IPv6 is proved over the loopback and the
  datagram path alone; the link local multicast group and a peer dialled by a link local address with
  its scope have not crossed a real interface (nor an IPv6-only network)
- [S · blocked: a phone] Android's background sync is proved by its rules in tests and by forced
  job runs on the emulator alone: when a real phone's Doze, standby buckets and maker's battery
  savers let the 15-minute wake run, and a carry-on finishing songs mid-transfer after the app is
  left, have not been seen
- [S · blocked: a device] The listening test is proved on the host alone (`resonate abx`'s session and
  keys, the boundary's object, the window's group under the test platform and the phones' wording): the commands it sends are checked at the
  engine's published settings, but no run has been heard on PipeWire with a real song, nor the
  sections driven on an emulator or an iPhone
- [M · blocked: hardware] A microphone recording not proved against real sound reaching a microphone
- [M · blocked: screen reader] No front end has been heard with a screen reader: the desktop's cells,
  links, lyric lines, plots, bars, cards, headings, dialogs, the caret and selection and the menu a
  reader follows are built and read back in tests only (Orca over AT-SPI; gpui's test platform never
  activates the tree), and neither TalkBack on the Compose screens nor VoiceOver on the SwiftUI app
  has read the accessibility work of 0.4.0 (the lyric elements, the adjustable bars, the hidden
  background under Now Playing, the announcements), and the iOS landscape and iPad layouts (Now
  Playing's two columns, the Library tab's split view, the sheets' form and page sizes, and the
  accessibility-size layouts in each) have been proved by their rules in tests and a clean build,
  never seen on an iPhone turned on its side or an iPad
- [S · blocked: hardware] The sideloaded IPA and its AltStore source are proved by their shape in
  tests: no release has yet been added as a source to SideStore or AltStore, signed with a free
  Apple ID and installed, so the declared permissions matching what AltStore reads from the IPA and
  the Enhanced Security entitlements passing a free profile are unseen
- [S · blocked: hardware] The iPhone Duo's poses are proved by their rules in tests and a clean
  build against the iOS 27.2 SDK, never seen on a Duo or the Duo simulator (Xcode's Device Hub needs a
  Mac): Now Playing's columns meeting at the fold held as a book, the cover above the fold and the
  controls below it on a table, Up next stopping short of the fold, and the inner screen edge to edge
- [S · blocked: a desktop] The desktop's colour scheme and text scale are proved on how a
  value is read alone: no GNOME or KDE session is reachable from the agent shell, so the portal's
  `color-scheme` and `SettingChanged`, GNOME's `text-scaling-factor` and KDE's `font` point size
  (taken against an ordinary ten) have not been read from a live portal, and the light palettes have
  been held by the contrast tests but not looked at in a window

## Dependencies
- [S · blocked: hdf5-reader] `cargo audit` calls `lru` 0.16.4 unsound (RUSTSEC-2026-0253, fixed from
  0.18.2), reached through `hdf5-reader` 0.12.1, the latest, under `resonate-codec`'s SOFA reader;
  `hdf5-reader` never calls the `LruCache::pop` the advisory names
- [S · blocked: gpui] `cargo audit`'s other warnings are other crates' trees: `glib` 0.18.5 unsound
  (RUSTSEC-2024-0429) under `tao`, `webkit2gtk` and wry, for `resonate-signin`'s window alone; zbus
  5 under gpui's accesskit and ashpd, beside `resonate-mpris`'s zbus 6 (two built), with
  `zvariant` and `zbus_names` unmaintained since they were merged into zbus 6; `rustybuzz` and
  `ttf-parser` under gpui's `usvg`; and the build-time `paste` (lofty), `proc-macro-error` (glib)
  and `basic-toml` (uniffi's askama)

## Later: Structure
- [L] `LibraryModel` (48 fields) and `RootView` (73) now hold their state in groups by subject
  (`ui.md`), but every pane's feature still passes through both, and `RootView::new` is some 750
  lines making 40 subscriptions: panes as entities owning their fields and subscriptions, once the
  `driven.rs` harness pins what they do
- [L] The phones' enrichment pass still copies the desktop's queueing: `resonate-mobile`'s
  `enrichment.rs` (`Sought`, `Pictures`, `Pass::walk` and `lift`, the lyric reader, and constants such
  as `PICTURES_WAITING_AT_MOST` and `PERFORMERS_WEIGHED_AT_MOST`) beside `resonate-library`'s
  `enrich.rs`. The strict rules and how an answer is heard (`hearing.rs`: refusals, the run that ends
  a pass, phrase then words) are shared; the queue, the seeks and the picture and lyric workers are
  not, so a fix to one is made twice. One pass over a small catalog trait both catalogs fill
- [L] A setting is still spelled in some eight files (`enrich-on-metered`: the binary's
  `config.rs` and `settings.rs`, core's `config_key.rs`, the window's `settings.rs` and four panes,
  the man page), though the window and the file now share one `ConfigKey`; one table of keys, types,
  defaults and groups both read would make a new setting one entry
- [M] The binary and the phones each carry the adapter that plays a service's song in place
  (`ServedSongs` and `Streaming` in `resonate`'s and `resonate-mobile`'s `served.rs`) and each build
  their providers from settings (`providers.rs`, `downloads.rs`), and the second pair already
  differs: the desktop registers `resonate` beside `hifi-api` where the phones turn a keyed hifi-api
  account into `resonate` alone; `resonate-library` reaches both seams and could hold one of each
- [M] Identical songs are found by one `identical_among` now, but folded by two paths: the desktop's
  `copies::handed_over` and the phones' `fold_identical_songs` (`deleting.rs`, over `handed_over`)
- [M] The vault builds two JPEG XL encoders, `zune-jpegxl` for a cover's pixels and `jxl-encoder`
  for a JPEG's transcode, though `jxl-encoder` 0.3.4 encodes losslessly and carries an ICC profile,
  which would let a cover with a profile become JXL too (`vault.md` keeps it as it came); whether it
  is as small and as fast as zune at its highest effort is unmeasured

## Later: Packaging
- [S · blocked: tooling] The sync server's RPM spec has never run: no `rpmbuild` here, and its
  workflow job (`fedora-server-rpm`) fires on a release or a manual dispatch alone

## Later: Together on the phones

- [S] Trying Wrapped, shared playlists and parties on a real iPhone: they build clean and their logic is tested, but the views have never run.
- [S] On Android, driving what the emulator run did not reach: the online-off banner, a list's songs not held, Remove in the sharing sheet, Paste a link, saving a typed name, leaving by dismissing the task and from the notification, and the service held through a pause.
- [S] A party between two real devices in different places, measuring the offset by ear or by loopback.
